      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Wash the potatoes with plenty of water and peel with a vegetable
          peeler. Cut them into four or six parts according to their size. You
          should get pieces of (at most) 5 cm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place them in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water and a teaspoon of
          salt. Cook half covered for at least 15 minutes until potatoes are
          soft. The way to test them is to prick them with a fork. If your fork
          meets little resistance, they are soft enough to puree.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the potatoes, let them drain for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>
          The best Causa Limeña meat is chicken breast. A small chicken breast
          gives around 300 grams of shredded chicken. Roast or boil the chicken
          according to your taste. Remember to add a pinch of salt and a little
          pepper for cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Peel the onion and chop finely.</li>
        <li>
          Boil the egg in plenty of water, and remove the shell. Cut it into
          thin slices.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the potatoes are still warm, place them in a large bowl, and
          with a potato masher, mash them until there are no lumps left.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash the chili peppers and place them on a cutting board. Remove the
          stem with a sharp knife, cut crosswise and remove all the veins and
          seeds. Cut the chili peppers into large pieces. Don’t worry about size
          because they will liquefy later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the oil and peppers into the blender glass. Beat for about three
          minutes. The mixture will not be completely homogeneous.
        </li>

        <li>
          Pour the chili sauce over the mashed potatoes with a pinch of salt and
          mash again for a few minutes until the chili is fully blended into
          potatoes. Taste and if necessary, rectify with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a mixing bowl place the shredded chicken. Make sure that all the
          chicken is finely chopped. Add mayonnaise, chopped onion, lime juice,
          and peas. Stir until all ingredients are well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the seed from the avocado, peel the skin away and cut the soft
          flesh into thin slices. Sprinkle a few drops of lime over the avocado
          slices to prevent it from turning brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the next step, the assembly of the causa rellena, use an empty can
          with the base and lid removed (using a can opener). If you wish, you
          can use a round mold or a square mold or even a glass container.
        </li>

        <li>
          Place the can on a flat plate and add two tablespoons of mashed
          potatoes. With a spoon or any other utensil that you consider
          convenient, press the mashed potatoes towards the bottom of the plate
          and flatten.
        </li>
        <li>Add a layer of avocado pieces.</li>
        <li>
          Then add three tablespoons of chicken with mayonnaise. Press down
          gently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover with a second layer of mashed potatoes and flatten once more.
          Very carefully remove the can by pulling it upwards. Repeat this
          procedure until you run out of ingredients. We make 6 Causas Limeñas
          with the ingredients listed above.
        </li>

        <li>
          On top of each Causa Limeña place an egg slice, a few black olives and
          some thin slices of yellow chili.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve individually as a starter for dinner or a cold appetizer for
          lunch.
